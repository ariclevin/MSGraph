# MSGraph

The zip solution file contains the Canvas Apps and two Power Automate flows needed to enable this app in your own environment.
This is an unmanaged solution so that you can customize it to you needs.

Instructions:
- Modify the Power Automate flows to include your own Graph Api authentication (Tenant Id, Client Id and Client Secret)
- Remove the Data References from your Canvas app, and then add them back again to make sure the changes are accepted.
